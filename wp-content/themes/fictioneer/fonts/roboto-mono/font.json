  "about": "Roboto Mono is a monospaced addition to the Roboto type family. Like the other members of the Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments. While the monospaced version is related to its variable width cousin, it doesnâ€™t hesitate to change forms to better fit the constraints of a monospaced environment.",
