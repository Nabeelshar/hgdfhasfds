  "about": "Cormorant is a free display type family developed by Christian Thalmann. While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.",
